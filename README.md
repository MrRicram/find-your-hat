## Features
To-do list:

- [ ] Create a “hard mode” where one or more holes are added after certain turns.
- [ ] Improve your game’s graphics and interactivity in the terminal. 
- [ ] Create a field validator to ensure that the field generated can actually be solved. 

## Status

As said above all prerequisites are implemented and the game works perfectly find. However there are still some extensions to be added until it's completely finished.
